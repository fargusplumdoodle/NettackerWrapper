## Nettacker Wrapper

The goal of this repo is a proof of concept for some aspects of a Capstone Project I am working on.

Goals:
1. Containerizing Nettacker with custom Dockerfile
2. Build an abstract Tool class
3. Build a Nettacker class that extends the Tool class
4. Successfully scan my raspberry Pi from python from docker from nettacker.
5. ??
6. Profit

Here are some sparkles for your troubles :sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:
